    <p>I watched it today with my kids and they loved it. You should have a minimal previous understanding of the story, or you will miss 40% of the fun. You should watch Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther, Age of Ultron, Ant-Man and the Wasp before watching Avengers: Endgame. The entire movie pays homage to most of the other Marvel superhero movies. You will enjoy it a lot. There is, at the beginning of the movie, a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. The movie is based on the most-talked action-packed Sci-fi series. The movie shows how the Avengers assemble once more in order to reverse Thanos' actions and restore balance to the universe. The movie is lengthy, and it does run for 3 hours all worthwhile.

<p>This show is really underrated and hated by a lot of people, but let me just say that itâ€™s AMAZING! The way storylines are brought out and continued are great, as well as the characters which include a lot of development throughout the series. The villains all have clear-cut explained motives based on important things, not some childish motive, so fights between the heroes and villains are intense. I love all the Doc Ock drama and I AM ADDICTED to all the Norman/Harry Osborn scenes, especially about Normanâ€™s vengeance on Spider-Man as the Green Goblin. 

  Some dialogues are cringey and some parts are boring, but everything else makes  up for it. The voice actors are perfect for every character. Although I at first wasnâ€™t a fan of Anya being Spider-Girl as well as Gwen and Miles also being in the same universe as Peter, it was great to see them working as a great team. The season finales are all so intense and awesome (season 2â€™s was breathtaking ðŸ¤©) so I always look forward to them! 
  
  I recommend this series to anyone who wants to get into Marvel and itâ€™s extremely useful for anyone who wants to know everything about Spider-Man, because at first when I didnâ€™t know anything about the villains or universes, after I watched it I came to know everything about Spider-Man. Please keep creating more seasons Marvel, because there are still many many people who love this Spider-Man series a lot.
